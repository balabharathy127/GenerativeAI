ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create realistic and novel fashion designs. It can be used for:
âœ” Design Inspiration â€“ Generate new clothing patterns, textures, and styles.
âœ” Virtual Try-Ons â€“ Assist in AI-powered fashion recommendation systems.
âœ” Data Augmentation â€“ Create synthetic datasets for training other ML models.

Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and PyTorch, this GAN learns from fashion datasets (e.g., Fashion-MNIST, DeepFashion) to produce high-quality synthetic images.
